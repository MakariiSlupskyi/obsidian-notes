### For Reddit

Hey everyone!

I'm a solo builder and I‚Äôve been working on a project called **Vizual** ‚Äî it‚Äôs an AI-powered visual coding platform that helps people design full-stack applications **and export real production code**, not just prototypes.

üõ†Ô∏è Why I built this:
I noticed that most visual or no-code tools are either too simple (like Scratch) or not flexible enough to build real-world apps. And traditional tools can feel overwhelming for beginners or solo indie makers.

So I thought‚Ä¶ what if you could:
- visually design apps (frontend, backend, API, DB),
- use AI to help you build logic/structure, and
- export clean, editable code for **React, Node, etc.**

 üöÄ What it does:
- Visual drag-and-drop UI builder with real component system
- Visual scripting for APIs and logic
- Database schema builder
- Real code export (React, Express, etc.)
- AI help for logic, refactoring, design hints

It‚Äôs like **Figma meets GitHub Copilot**, but full-stack.

 üîç Why I'm here:
I‚Äôd love to get your honest feedback ‚Äî whether you're learning to code, building your own startup, or teaching programming.

I'm offering **free early access** for anyone curious. You can check it out here: [Landing Page Link or DM me]

Thanks for reading, happy to answer any questions or hear your thoughts!

### Frontend Editor (UI + Logic)

### Backend Editor (API + Database)

### Project Editor (microservices + brokers)

Service-first

**Project**
- Services

**Frontend Service**
- UI

**Backend Service**
- API

**UI**
- tree of components where each can call action

**Component**
- a function that returns UI and can have state

**Action**
- basically a function
- described with VizualScript

**VizualScript (VS)**
- Static- & strong-typed scripting language that describes logic (data transformation)
- Is to be trans-compiled to any targer language (Go, TypeScript, Python)

**Block**
- Main UI primitive and action caller
- Some action can be caller by triggers
- **Trigger**
	- eg. onClick, onHover
